Forensibus is a modern data processing tool dedicated to forensic analysts and incident responders. It was built to solve the following problems:

- Forensic data comes in a wide variety of formats. In case of incident response, the format may not be known in advance (DFIR collection tools, raw disks, event logs, EDR telemetry, ...).

- These challenges are exacerbated by the increase in the size of the networks and the volume of data collected. Improved efficiency of the digital investigation process is needed, in terms of increasing the speed and reducing the human effort.

- The Digital Forensic Investigation process is largely manual in nature, or at best semi-automated

Forensibus aims to improve efficiency by emphasizing automation within the digital forensic triage process.


## Architecture Overview

The objective is to carry out the ETL (extract - transform - load) process by reading the raw artifacts and then formatting them so that they can be loaded into a database for further analysis.
