Forensibus is a modern data processing tool dedicated to forensic analysts and incident responders. It was built to solve the following problems:

- In most companies data tends to be in silos, stored in various formats and is often inaccurate or inconsistent (DFIR collection tools, raw disks, event logs, EDR telemetry, ...).

- These challenges are exacerbated by the increase in the size of the networks and the volume of data collected. Improved efficiency of the digital investigation process is needed, in terms of increasing the speed and reducing the human effort.

- The Digital Forensic Investigation process is largely manual in nature, or at best semi-automated

Forensibus aims to improve efficiency by emphasizing automation within the digital forensic triage process.

## Architecture Overview

Forensibus is an ETL focused on digital forensics artifacts. ETL stands for _Extract-Transform-Load_, is usually involves moving data from one or many sources, making changes, and then loading it into a new single destination.
